# IOT PROJECT: TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDTY MONITORING #
A simple IOT project that utilize python based web app in django and dbsqlite3 database



## Problem statement: ##

People nowadays mostly did not benefit from the use of IoT in their home applications such as monitoring the temperature and humidity inside their home. By using IoT, the user can save electricity by controlling and monitoring the power consumption efficiently for example in use of the air conditioner.

## Design Statement: ## 

To maintain the room air conditioning at the suitable temperature and humidity using IoT air monitoring

## Solution: ## 

By using a temperature and humidity monitoring system that is able to be sent to the cloud and be displayed for the consumer to view at the same time communicating with the controller to turn on the fan

## Project Overview: ##

Sensor : ESP8266 Description - We are using HTTP data transmission protocol to send the data into Database

Cloud Platform : Python Anywhere Description - PythonAnywhere is a cloud-based platform that allows users to run and host Python applications in the cloud.
